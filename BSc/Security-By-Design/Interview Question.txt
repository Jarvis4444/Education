Paul: Hi D! hope you and everyone else is doing good!! I was wondering if I could ask a weird question? my course is surrounding neonates and I was wondering about the procedure when it comes to looking after the babies?

D: Hi Paul, I’m good I hope your ok!!! If it’s medical intervention we have to act in the babies best interest and we go on protocols to preserve life, but if a baby is very sick and not likely to survive then we will advise and get parents consent to withdraw care or to not resuscitate their baby if they collapse or get worse, I hope that makes sense! But we always inform parents of descions we make and it is always good when they give us consent x

Paul: Yes this helps so much D!!! thank you so much xx
